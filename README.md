# Hi, Christo here👋

I'm a data-savvy consultant with a background in RGM, anaytics, and business intelligence. I turn messy commercial data into clean, actionable insight—mostly using Python, SQL, and visual storytelling (charts > small talk).

## ⚒️ Projects
- **Promo Analysis with Nielsen Sell-Out**  
  Using sell-out data to identify promo uplift, ROI, duration, and frequency—because “was it worth it?” should be answerable.
  
- **Ice Cream KPI Dashboard**  
  Visualizing performance metrics for an ice cream brand. Cold data, clean charts, no brain freeze.
  
- **More to come**  
  Clean tools for not-so-clean data are always in the pipeline.
